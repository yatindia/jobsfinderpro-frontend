                      Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
                      (“Subscription(s)”). After an agreed Free Trial period expires, you will be
                      billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”).
                      Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on
                      the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically
                      renew under the exact same conditions unless you affirmatively cancel it or
                      JobsFinderPro cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal by
                      contacting JobsFinderPro customer support team.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the
                      payment for your Subscription. You shall provide JobsFinderPro with
                      accurate and complete billing information including full name, address,
                      state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information.
                      By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize
                      JobsFinderPro to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account
                      to any such payment instruments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, JobsFinderPro will
                      issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually,
                      within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the
                      billing period as indicated on the invoice. If such payment it not made
                      then your access to the Service may be interrupted or cancelled, in each
                      case with no obligation or liability to JobsFinderPro.

                      JobsFinderPro, in its sole and absolute discretion (“Discretion”) and at
                      any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any
                      Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the
                      then-current Billing Cycle. JobsFinderPro will provide you with a
                      reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an
                      opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes
                      effective. Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee
                      change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified
                      Subscription fee amount.
