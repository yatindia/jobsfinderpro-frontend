                    <p>
                        You hereby expressly and voluntarily grant your informed consent to us to
                        deal with your personal information in accordance with the terms and
                        conditions of this Privacy Policy. Should you retract your consent, please
                        contact us. If you retract your consent, you acknowledge and agree that
                        failure to provide certain types of personal information may not give you
                        access to the full functionality of the Service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Deletion.</strong>
                        <strong></strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have
                        collected from you. This right is subject to certain exceptions: for
                        example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the
                        Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If
                        your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny
                        your deletion request.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To exercise the rights described above, you must send us a request that (1)
                        provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the
                        person about whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describes your
                        request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate, and
                        respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be
                        considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not
                        meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid
                        Request to verify you and complete your request. You do not need an account
                        to submit a Valid Request.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We
                        will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid
                        Request(s) is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we
                        determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the
                        fee and explain that decision before completing your request.
